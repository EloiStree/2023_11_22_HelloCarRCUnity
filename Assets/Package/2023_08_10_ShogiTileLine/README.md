This tools allows to store line where elements are split by  ♦ and the shogi ☗ is use as parameter  in the cells.

The idea here is that when you want to configure a file where you know the content, you can use XML and JSON but they are too geeky.

You can use CSV but the spliter are commonly use in text (; \n ,).

So I use line to import the use information and the cells are created between ♦ .

(Add example and demo)
